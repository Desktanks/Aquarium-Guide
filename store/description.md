**Aquaria** helps you design a healthy aquarium and handle problems calmly. It produces clear, cited plans for gear, water targets, cycling, and weekly care—plus humane troubleshooting when things go sideways.

**Why it feels different**
- Focused: two core jobs—Build/Setup and Care/Troubleshooting—done well.
- Trustworthy: factual claims include citations from vetted sources.
- Ethical: sponsored links are disclosed, with a non-sponsored alternative every time.

**What you can do**
- “Design a 10-gallon shrimp tank for a beginner.”
- “Cloudy water on day 3—what should I do?”
- “Quiet filter for a 20-gallon bedroom tank; full plan please.”

**Data & safety**
No logins, no PII collection. Optional analytics are off by default. Humane-care guardrails prevent risky advice.
