I can suggest safer methods and products with citations.\n\nSafer options:\n- Reduce light period to 6–8 hours; manual removal.\n- Spot-treat with peroxide *out of tank* on decor, then rinse thoroughly before re-adding.\n- Improve nutrient balance: live plants and consistent water changes.\n\nIf you share tank size and current parameters, I’ll tailor a plan.",
