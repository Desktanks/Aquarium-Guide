    "overview": "Cloudiness in a new setup is usually a harmless bacterial bloom. Don’t panic; aim for stability.",
    "likely_causes": [
      "Normal bacterial bloom during early cycling",
      "Overfeeding in an uncycled tank",
      "Disturbed fine substrate"
    ],
    "fix_steps": [
      "Stop feeding until cycling completes.",
      "Run filter continuously; point outlet at surface for oxygenation.",
      "Avoid large water changes; if visibility is near zero, do 15% changes every 48h.",
      "Test daily; only add livestock when ammonia and nitrite are both 0 for 3 consecutive days."
    ],
    "prevention": [
      "Feed very lightly during the first 1–2 weeks.",
      "Rinse new substrate thoroughly before use.",
      "Add hardy live plants to compete with excess nutrients."
