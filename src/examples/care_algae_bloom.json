    "overview": "Algae blooms are common in young planted tanks. We’ll trim light and nutrients without risky chemicals.",
    "likely_causes": [
      "Excess light duration for a new tank",
      "Nutrient imbalance (high nitrate, low competition from plants)",
      "Immature biofilter"
    ],
    "fix_steps": [
      "Reduce photoperiod to 6–8 hours; keep a strict timer.",
      "Manual remove: swirl and net floating clumps; wipe glass.",
      "Add fast growers (hornwort, floaters) to soak up nutrients.",
      "Weekly 25% water change until nitrate stays <20 ppm."
    ],
    "prevention": [
      "Gradually increase light after 4–6 weeks if plants demand it.",
      "Avoid overfeeding; keep stable CO2 from good surface agitation.",
      "Test nitrate weekly and trim plants to maintain growth."
