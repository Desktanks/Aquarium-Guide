# Research & Citations — Aquaria (v1)

**Goal:** Every factual claim about species, parameters, safety, or treatments is backed by a traceable source.

## Rules
1) If a fact matters to animal welfare, equipment safety, water chemistry, or medication → it **must** have a citation.
2) Prefer expert sources; if sources conflict, say so and choose the conservative path.
3) Never copy manufacturer claims without independent confirmation.
4) Quote snippets ≤ 25 words only when essential; otherwise paraphrase.
5) If no source is available, label the statement as opinion or avoid it.

## Source Tiers (pick highest available)
- **Tier A:** Peer-reviewed journals, academic texts, regulatory bodies.
- **Tier B:** Established databases and humane organizations.
- **Tier C:** Reputable practitioner guides with transparent authorship.
- **Tier D (avoid):** Anonymous forums, promotional pages without data.

- fishbase.se
- rspca.org.uk / aspca.org
- aquariumcoop.com (knowledge base)
